# Yet another revamp
So I've hit my limitation on static pages and I wanna branch out to making a full personalised app for teaching my students.

Reason I want to move to dynamic website / creating a web app.
1) I want to host classroom materials here. Protected by a password / user authentication.
2) I want to host personalized (w/ logins, etc) quizes with students.
3) Use templating and make the website not have to load a new HTML evertime users go to a  page that has a similar layout LOL

## My plan so far / Outline
1) Landing page for me and my info.
2) Log ins for students.
3) Link / Navigation to the Classroom segment.
4) In the classroom section have navigation to the materials by class and quizes too.

## What tech stack?
I want to use this opportunity to learn the MERN stack or any industry standard stack that would help me understand and learn what it is like to be a full stack engineer.

So the stack might be: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js *might change

## Hosting?
TBH IDK. I still own adham.forum and a VPS that has like 800MB of ram (both till next april) and IDT that is enough and I will need to renew.

I was thinking of doing it using CloudFlare workers.
