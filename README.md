# OVERHAUL VERSION
This is V2 of my website because I am not satisfied with the current design. The last design or the origin branch was just a tester to get me to actually start making the actual website.

# Format / Framework
As they say, when a web dev doens't use a framework, they more or less create their own. So I am making a mini framework for this website.

# adham.forum
I made this repo because I keep procrastinating making my portfolio @ [adham.forum](https://adham.forum). 

## Simplicity
I do not know what features I will add but so far i think simple is best thats it.

## Disclaimer
Not 'built' by me just taking ideas and other people's code and making it to my taste.
Code might even be terrible but I'm trying to learn here.
